# Terminal Setup
These files are intended to help you bootstrap a new development environment so you can quickly be as productive as possible.
These scripts install and update:

  * [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/)
  * [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
  * [git](https://git-scm.com/)
  * [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/), a command-line JSON processor
  * [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
  * [python](https://www.python.org/)
  * [aws cli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
  * [ag](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher), the silver searcher
  * ... along with dependencies needed to install the above.

## In Ubuntu
As the script indicates, use `source ~/install-it-all-ubuntu.sh`

When you want to update everything, run `update-it-all-ubuntu.sh`.

## In Windows
So far my favorite Linux-like environment in Windows is [Babun](https://babun.github.io/).

After the initial Babun install, run `install-it-all-babun.sh`.

Whenever you're in the mood to update all the things, run `update-it-all-babun.sh`.
