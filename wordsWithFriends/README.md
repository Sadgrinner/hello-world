# Words With Friends Word Lists

I've reconstructed various versions of the legal/playable word list in Words With Friends since the allowable words have evolved over time.

All credit to the following two sites:

My many thanks to [Mick West](http://cowboyprogramming.com/about/) and [Anthony Tan](http://www.greenworm.net/personal).
