hello-world
===========

What will this repository end up containing?  Links, resources, snippets, to-dos?  A personal wiki?  My dotfiles, .gitignore, IDE preference and settings files?  Reference material, tutorials, notes-to-self, how-to guides?

### Initial forays
I've added [Java8 links](java8/java8.md) for resources about Streams and Lambda expressions.

Or see my [Words With Friends resources](wordsWithFriends) to see a collection of word lists.

### On editing
For editing ```README.md``` files, I like using the live (Github-flavored) Markdown Editor [here](http://jbt.github.io/markdown-editor/).

### A Keyboard project
A physical project: designing a [custom keyboard](keyboardProject/keyboard.md) with the Carpalx QGMLWY layout.

So many ideas!  So many starting places!
