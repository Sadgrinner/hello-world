hello-world
===========

What will this repository end up containing?  Links, resources, snippets, to-dos?  A personal wiki?  My dotfiles, .gitignore, IDE preference and settings files?  Reference material, tutorials, notes-to-self, how-to guides?

So many ideas!  So many starting places!

**Thanks for stopping by!**
